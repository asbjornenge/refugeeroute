# RefugeeRoute

## Idea

A webpage which shows the different routes that refugees take / can take through Europe.

At every checkpoint a reporting team is sent through to broadcast live 24/7. We could also have various teams which
roam between the different checkpoints documenting and broadcasting live (headcams?).

Site visitors can get descriptions of the routes, statistics, etc by clicking on checkpoints or "on-foot-teams" in order
to get a live feed from the various locations.


## Goal

1. Documentation
2. Iv we can affect both refugees, local authorities, and the general population in Europe; we can maybe contribute to
   creating a "refugee corridor" where aid measures can be set in and refugees can travel safely.
3. Raise awareness
4. Offer direct communications channel between refugees and support systems?


## Economy

* Volunteers
* Kickstarter?
* Contributions from volunteers, help organisations, governments?
* NRK? (Norwegian media outlet)
* Innovasjon Norge? (Norwegian entrepeneurship fund/assistance)
* Advertising? :-/

Presumably this would get good traffic!
Can potentially be used in all other refugee situations around the world as well.
